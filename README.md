# Compiler Design Experiments

This repository contains a series of experiments and programs related to compiler design. Each experiment is designed to explore fundamental concepts and techniques used in building compilers.

## Experiments in Order

1. **Simple Calculator**
   - This experiment involves creating a basic calculator using lex and yacc (or flex and bison), demonstrating lexical analysis and parsing.

2. **Flex Program**
   - Implementation of a lexical analyzer using Flex (Fast Lexical Analyzer Generator), showcasing tokenization of input.

3. **Scanner Program**
   - Development of a scanner (tokenizer) program, focusing on recognizing patterns in input strings.

4. **Bison Program**
   - Creation of a parser using Bison (GNU Parser Generator), demonstrating syntax analysis and parsing techniques.

5. **First and Follow Program**
   - Implementation of the First and Follow sets computation algorithm for a given grammar.

6. **Left Factoring**
   - Experiment to eliminate left factoring from a grammar, addressing grammar ambiguity and efficiency.

7. **Left Recursion**
   - Exploration of techniques to remove left recursion from a grammar, essential for avoiding infinite loops in parsing.

8. **SLR Parsing**
   - Implementation of SLR (Simple LR) parsing for a grammar, demonstrating bottom-up parsing techniques.

9. **Java Program**
   - Development of a Java-based compiler component, integrating concepts learned from previous experiments into a practical program.

Each experiment folder contains source code and possibly additional documentation or explanatory files to understand the concepts and implementations.
