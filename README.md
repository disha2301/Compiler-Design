# üñ•Ô∏è Compiler Design Experiments

Welcome to the Compiler Design Experiments repository! üöÄ This repository contains a series of experiments and programs related to compiler design. Each experiment explores fundamental concepts and techniques used in building compilers.

## üìã Experiments in Order

1. **Simple Calculator**
   - This experiment involves creating a basic calculator using lex and yacc (or flex and bison), demonstrating lexical analysis and parsing.

2. **Flex Program**
   - Implementation of a lexical analyzer using Flex (Fast Lexical Analyzer Generator), showcasing tokenization of input.

3. **Scanner Program**
   - Development of a scanner (tokenizer) program, focusing on recognizing patterns in input strings.

4. **Bison Program**
   - Creation of a parser using Bison (GNU Parser Generator), demonstrating syntax analysis and parsing techniques.

5. **First and Follow Program**
   - Implementation of the First and Follow sets computation algorithm for a given grammar.

6. **Left Factoring**
   - Experiment to eliminate left factoring from a grammar, addressing grammar ambiguity and efficiency.

7. **Left Recursion**
   - Exploration of techniques to remove left recursion from a grammar, essential for avoiding infinite loops in parsing.

8. **SLR Parsing**
   - Implementation of SLR (Simple LR) parsing for a grammar, demonstrating bottom-up parsing techniques.

9. **Java Program**
   - Development of a Java-based compiler component, integrating concepts learned from previous experiments into a practical program.

Each experiment folder contains source code and possibly additional documentation or explanatory files to understand the concepts and implementations.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To explore these experiments:

1. **Clone this repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/compiler-design-experiments.git
2. **Requirements:**</br>
  - For experiments involving Lex and Yacc (Flex and Bison), ensure you have these tools installed on your system. </br>
  - Java experiments may require a JDK (Java Development Kit) installed.
